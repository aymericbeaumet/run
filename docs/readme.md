Welcome to Run's documentation. Run is a lightweight, standalone tool that manages tasks and processes for you. It is written in 100% in safe rust, is working on all the major operating systems, and is virtually compatible with any stack or language.

This documentation should give you a good idea of how Run can be benefitial to you, and how you can get the most out of it. If you have questions, feel free to come to the [discussions](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/run/discussions) on GitHub.
