# Examples

These examples are here to give you a good idea of what's possible to do with workbench.

Btw, workbench is heavily tested. Even the examples are being part of the test suite. Do not pay attention to the `workbench.toml.{stdout,stderr,status}` files, you will not have them in your project :blush:.
